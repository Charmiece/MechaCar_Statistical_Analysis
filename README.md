According to the Pr(>|t|) value, the vehicle lenght and the vehicle ground clearance are the most likely to provide a non-random event.
The slope of the line is not zero because the p-value 5.35e-11 is much smaller than the significance level of 0.05%.
The R-squared is equal to 71% which is efficent enough to predict the mpf of MechaCar prototypes.
